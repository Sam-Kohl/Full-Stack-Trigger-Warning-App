## Optimizations




## Lessons Learned:


Originally, I designed the app for Reddit users to be able to hide submissions/comments with containing a given word or words. 
It turns out that, although Reddit allows users to hide whole submissions, it does not allow for users to hide specific comments.
Due to this, I converted the tool into one for Moderator's to easily remove multiple submissions/comments/replies based on given "Trigger Words" and auto-send a removal message.
